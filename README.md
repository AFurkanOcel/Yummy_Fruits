# 🍉 Yummy Fruits

**Platform**: PC  

Welcome to **Yummy Fruits**, a fun 3D (2.5D-style) fruit collecting game where you control a log holding an axe and try to catch falling fruits and vegetables.  

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

In Yummy Fruits, players control a log from a side perspective (2.5D style). Fruits and vegetables like red apples, green apples, pineapples, eggplants, pomegranates, tomatoes, and oranges fall from above. Collect as many as possible within 1 minute. A timer at the top shows how many seconds are left, and the game also tracks how many of each fruit you have collected.  

The game starts from a menu. From the in-game interface, you can pause, resume, restart, or return to the main menu. When the time runs out, a **"Time is Over!"** message appears, along with the total number of fruits collected in that session.
